						///		INSTRUCTIONS	\\\

1. Read the questions carefully and then fill in the missing gaps in the code to
produce the required output.

2. The missing gaps are indicated by << ... >>> or <<< insert code here >>>

3. Go through the do file and questions sequentially.

4. All parts of the code involving a loop or a local variable need to be 
executed together. Please ask your TA to explain in the TP in case you have any 
questions.

5. None of the regression models you will run in this homework include additional
controls used by the authors in the paper. 

6. Please book slots during the Helpdesks if you have any doubts or need help.

							/// Q1: Preliminaries \\\

							
*... Define indicator for treated boroughs

gen treat=0 
replace treat=1 if ocu==1 | ocu==2 | ocu==3 | ocu==6 | ocu==14 //520 real changes made 
//borough IDs 1,2,3,6,14 are in the treatment group

label var treat "1=treated boroughs; 0=control boroughs"


*... Define indicator for policy period & previous year comparison period 

gen policy=0

replace policy=1 if week>=80 & week<=85 //policy was implemented between weeks 80-85 (inclusive)
replace policy=2 if week>=28 & week<=33

label var policy "1=6 weeks of Operation Theseus; 0=same 6 weeks in the previous year"
/* Note: The variable << policy >> defined here can be understood as the 
<< POST >> variable in a standard 2 period DID model */



keep if policy!=0 //2944 obs deleted 
/* We keep only 12 weeks of data for this part of the analysis 
(6 weeks of policy and 6 weeks in the previous year which is the comparison period) */

sort policy ocu week


/* Note: At this stage our dataset is at the borough-week level. In order to 
compute the raw difference-in-difference we need two observations per borough 
which contain the average of total crime and total police hours in the 
pre-period and the post-period. To do this we use the "collapse" command in Stata. 
You can see details of this command by typing << help collapse >> in the Stata 
command window */

collapse crime h pop treat, by(policy ocu) 


*... Let us create the interaction variable between treatment status and post-period. Let us also normalize crime by population.

gen treatXpolicy=treat*policy		//create interaction between treatment and policy

gen crimepop=(crime/pop)*1000

gen hpop=(h/pop)*1000



				/// Q2: Computing double difference manually \\\

			
/*... Now we compute the average police and crime in the treatment and control
groups in the pre and post period */


* Police
sum hpop if treat==1 & policy==0 [aw=pop] //the authors use analytic weights by borough population, to replicate their results, we will do the same when generating all our results
scalar P10=hpop //store the average hpop in this scalar, try using (help summarize) to see what the mean is stored as 

sum hpop if treat==1 & policy==1 [aw=pop]
scalar P11=hpop 
 
sum hpop if treat==0 & policy==0 [aw=pop]
scalar P00=hpop

sum hpop if treat==0 & policy==1 [aw=pop]
scalar P01=hpop


* Crime
sum crimepop if treat==1 & policy==0 [aw=pop]
scalar C10=crimepop

sum crimepop if treat==1 & policy==1 [aw=pop]
scalar C11=crimepop

sum crimepop if treat==0 & policy==0 [aw=pop]
scalar C00=crimepop

sum crimepop if treat==0 & policy==1 [aw=pop]
scalar C01=crimepop


*... The raw difference-in-difference is given by:

display "DID Police:" (P11 - P10)-(P01 - P00)	// write down the double diff using the averages obtained above

display "DID Crime:" (C11 - C10)-(C01 - C00)    // write down the double diff using the averages obtained above



		/// Q3: Calculating DD and standard errors using Regression \\\


*... The regression gives you the DD and its standard error directly!


* Police

reg hpop policy treat treatXpolicy [aw=pop], cluster(ocu)  // think about what regression you will run in a 2x2 DID

* Crime

reg crimepop policy treat treatXpolicy [aw=pop], cluster(ocu) // also weight your regression with borough population and cluster SE at the borough level


//sth weird: i get very significant yet very wierd coefficients: very negative for hpop (i would expect very positive like in treatedXpolicy areas: more hours, significantly wrt nontreated areas in the time period of Theseus operation)
//conversely for crimepop i get a positive coefficient for treatedXpolicy (very significant): we expect however sth negative: less crime in treated areas during the Theseus operation.

						/// Q2: Reduced Form \\\
						

*... DID Estimates on police deployment (hours per 1000 population)

** Not splitting post-attack period

* We use the Stata prefix 'xi' in order to specify that the following regression has a categorical variable. This is not necessary in newer versions of Stata, but for given the age of this paper, is required to reproduce the results. Learn more with (help xi).

xi: reg dlhpop treatXfull full i.week [aw=pop], cluster(ocu)	
	
	/* Notes: the above code should help you understand (1) how to weight your regressions,
	(2) how to cluster standard errors and (3) to include << xi >> when creating 
	dummies from a categorical variable (think about what i.week does!)  */

	
** Splitting post-attack period into 2 parts

xi: reg dlhpop treatXpost post i.week [aw=pop], cluster(ocu)	// include week FE, cluster SE at borough level, weight regression with borough population




*... DID Estimates on total crime (crime per 1000 population)

** Not splitting post-attack period

xi: reg dlcrimepop treatXfull full i.week [aw=pop], cluster(ocu)	// include week FE, cluster SE at borough level, weight regression with borough population


** Splitting post-attack period into 2 parts

xi: reg dlcrimepop treatXpost post i.week [aw=pop], cluster(ocu)		// include week FE, cluster SE at borough level, weight regression with borough population



					/// Q3: Structural Results \\\
					
					
*... OLS Estimates and split post-attack period into two parts 

xi: reg dlcrimepop dlhpop policy post i.week [aw=pop],cluster(ocu) 



*... IV Estimates and split post-attack period into two parts 

** First Stage and test of weak instruments

xi: reg dlhpop treatXpolicy treatXpost i.week [aw=pop],cluster(ocu)	// run first stage with treatXpolicy and treatXpost as excluded instruments
						// include week FE, cluster SE at borough level, weight regression with borough pop.
						

test treatXpolicy treatXpost				// check if excluded instruments are weak or not
//we reject the null hypothesis with very high level of confidence: instruments are not weak? 

** 2SLS 

xi:ivregress 2sls dlcrimepop dlhpop policy post treatXpolicy treatXpost i.week [aw=pop],cluster(ocu)	// include week FE, cluster SE at borough level, weight regression with borough pop.


//question: why are some time dummy coeffcients omitted?? more precisely, coef is zero and reobust standard error is omitted. why tf??
